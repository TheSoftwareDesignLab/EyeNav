\begin{abstract}

Alternative methods for interacting with computers have become increasingly popular, allowing the development of more accessible and intuitive systems. From this idea came EyeNav, a novel system that combines eye tracking and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance accessibility and enable automated test generation. The integration of these technologies for intuitive web interaction, enabling pointer control via gaze and natural language processing for interpreting user intentions, also presents a record-and-replay module for generating automated test scripts. Preliminary user evaluations yielded positive results in terms of usability. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that this tool effectively used not only as a possible assistive technology but also as an innovative approach to software testing.
