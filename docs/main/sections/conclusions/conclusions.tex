\section{Conclusions}

This study has demonstrated the successful integration of eye-tracking and NLP to create an accessible and intuitive user interaction system. The EyeNav system provides a compelling system, facilitating automated test generation. Despite limitations in accommodating diverse user conditions, the results underscore its potential for broad applications across various domains, such as Human-Computer Interaction, record and replay testing, NLP for voice commands, etc. Future research should aim to expand its usability among underrepresented user groups and explore applications in virtual and augmented reality, since eyetracking and voice controls are also being used in these areas.
