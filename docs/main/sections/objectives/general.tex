\section{General Objective}


The primary objective of this project is to leverage eye tracking combined with natural language processing technologies as user input methods for interacting with computers. By combining eye tracking for pointer control and natural language processing for specifying commands, the project seeks to create assistive technology that facilitates computer use. Additionally, the project aims to explore the potential of this interaction model for automating the generation of test scripts in a record-and-replay manner for web applications.
